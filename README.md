Of course! Here’s a **short, clean "Description" section** you can directly use in your GitHub README in the standard format:

## 📄 Description

This project analyzes and predicts car prices using Power BI. It explores a dataset containing car details such as brand, model, engine size, mileage, fuel type, transmission, year, and condition. The analysis includes custom DAX measures and interactive dashboards to identify pricing trends, brand contributions, and market distribution across fuel types and conditions.

Key insights reveal how brand, fuel type, and condition influence car prices, with Toyota, BMW, and Audi leading in overall market value. The project helps stakeholders understand the car market landscape and supports data-driven pricing strategies.

Let me know if you'd also like me to include a one-liner summary for the very top of your README (under the title), or a short tagline!
